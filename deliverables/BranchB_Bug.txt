There were two reasons the deleteNote function was note working correctly. The first was the issue with the backend code in server.js.
In server.js, the code for deleting a note only printed out to the user that the code could not be deleted. There was no code that
actually searched through the database for the note and deleted it. The second issue was in the frontend code. In the frontend code
after checking that (!response.ok) was false, there should have been code to delete the note. But that code was missing and was only 
checking for errors right after. After fixing those two issues, deleteNote now works correctly.
